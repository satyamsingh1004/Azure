Logic Apps
Microsoft Power Automate:Under the hood, Microsoft Power Automate is built on Logic Apps. 
This fact means that Power Automate supports the same range of connectors and actions. You can also use custom connectors in Microsoft Power Automate.

Code-first technologies:
WebJobs and the WebJobs SDK:
You have specific customizations that you want to make to the JobHost that are not supported by Azure Functions.
For example, in a WebJob, you can create a custom retry policy for calls to external systems. 
This kind of policy can't be configured in an Azure Function.
There are two kinds of WebJob:Continuous & Triggered
Azure Functions:

Drawbacks of a serverless compute solution:
Execution time:
By default, functions have a timeout of 5 minutes. This timeout is configurable to a maximum of 10 minutes. 
If your function requires more than 10 minutes to execute, you can host it on a VM. 
Additionally, if your service is initiated through an HTTP request and you expect that value as an HTTP response, the timeout is further restricted to 2.5 minutes. 
Finally, there's also an option called Durable Functions that allows you to orchestrate the executions of multiple functions without any timeout.
Execution frequency:

Functions are hosted in an execution context called a function app.

There are three Authorization levels:
Function
Anonymous
Admin
